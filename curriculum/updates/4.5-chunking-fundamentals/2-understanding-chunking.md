# Understanding Text Chunking

Before you can vectorize documents, you need to break them into smaller pieces. This is called **chunking**, and it's critical to RAG system quality.

## What You'll Learn

-   Why chunking is necessary for RAG
-   Bad vs. good chunking strategies
-   How overlap preserves context
-   How to implement sentence-aware chunking

## Why Chunking Matters

### The Problem

**Documents are too long:**

-   Embedding models have token limits (8,191 tokens)
-   Entire document = diluted meaning ("average" of everything)
-   User asks about hooks → retrieves entire 50,000-word doc
-   Can't fit huge docs in LLM context window

### The Solution

```
50,000-word Document
        ↓
Break into 100 chunks of 500 chars each
        ↓
Each chunk = focused topic
        ↓
Retrieve only relevant chunks
```

**Benefits:**

-   Focused, specific meaning per chunk
-   Better embeddings (captures specific concepts)
-   Precise retrieval (get exactly what you need)
-   Fits in context windows

---

## Bad Chunking Examples

### ❌ Character Splitting

```typescript
function badCharacterChunking(text: string): string[] {
	return text.match(/.{1,500}/g) || [];
}

// Results in:
// "The company announced new feat"
// "ures including advanced AI c"
```

**Problem:** Breaks words mid-character!

### ❌ Word Splitting

```typescript
function badWordChunking(text: string): string[] {
	const words = text.split(' ');
	const chunks = [];
	for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i += 100) {
		chunks.push(words.slice(i, i + 100).join(' '));
	}
	return chunks;
}
```

**Problem:** Ignores sentence boundaries!

### Real Example

```typescript
// Original: "React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8. They allow you to use state..."

// ❌ Bad chunking produces:
[
	'React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8. They allow you to use state without wri',
	'ting a class component...',
];

// "wri" and "ting" are split - meaningless!
```

## Good Chunking: Sentence-Aware + Overlap

### The Strategy

```typescript
export type Chunk = {
	id: string;
	content: string;
	metadata: {
		source: string;
		chunkIndex: number;
		totalChunks: number;
		startChar: number;
		endChar: number;
	};
};
```

**Key principles:**

1. Split by sentences (`.`, `!`, `?`)
2. Combine sentences until size limit
3. Add overlap between chunks
4. Track metadata

---

## Why Overlap Matters

**Without Overlap:**

```
Chunk 1: "...useState is a hook."
Chunk 2: "It returns a pair of values..."
```

User: "what does useState return?"

-   Chunk 1 has "useState" but not "return" ❌
-   Chunk 2 has "return" but not "useState" ❌

**With Overlap (50 chars):**

```
Chunk 1: "...useState is a hook."
Chunk 2: "useState is a hook. It returns a pair of values..."
```

User: "what does useState return?"

-   Chunk 2 has BOTH "useState" AND "return" ✅

### How Much Overlap?

-   **Too little** (10 chars): Not enough context
-   **Too much** (90%): Wasteful
-   **Just right** (10-20% of chunk size): Perfect

For 500-char chunks → 50-100 char overlap

## Your Challenge: Implement the `getLastWords` Function

The chunking logic is provided, **but you need to implement the critical `getLastWords()` helper function**. This function creates the overlap between chunks that preserves context.

### Why This Function Matters

Without proper overlap, chunks lose context:

```typescript
// Without getLastWords (no overlap):
Chunk 1: "React Hooks allow you to use state."
Chunk 2: "The most common hooks are useState."
// Query: "What do React Hooks do?" → Might miss Chunk 2!

// With getLastWords (proper overlap):
Chunk 1: "React Hooks allow you to use state."
Chunk 2: "allow you to use state. The most common hooks are useState."
// Query: "What do React Hooks do?" → Finds both chunks! ✅
```

### Test-Driven Development Approach

**Step 1: Run the tests to see failures**

```bash
yarn test:chunking
```

Some tests will fail because `getLastWords()` isn't implemented!

**Step 2: Understand what `getLastWords` should do**

```typescript
getLastWords('React Hooks are awesome', 10);
// Should return: "are awesome" (10 chars, complete words)
// NOT: "re awesome" (broken word!)

getLastWords('Short', 100);
// Should return: "Short" (entire text if shorter than max)
```

**Step 3: Find the function in the code**

Open `app/libs/chunking.ts` and scroll to the bottom. You'll see:

```typescript
function getLastWords(text: string, maxLength: number): string {
	// YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE
}
```

**Step 4: Implement the function**

Here's your implementation guide:

```typescript
function getLastWords(text: string, maxLength: number): string {
	// Step 1: If text is short enough, return it all

	// Step 2: Split text into words

	// Step 3: Build result string (start empty)

	// Step 4: Loop BACKWARDS through words (from end to start)
	// Step 5: Check if adding this word would exceed maxLength
	// Remember to account for space between words!

	// Step 6: Prepend word to result (building backwards)

	// Step 7: Return the result
	return result;
}
```

**Step 5: Test your implementation**

```bash
yarn test:chunking
```

All tests should pass! ✅

## Need Help?

**Stuck on the implementation?**

1. Check the detailed steps in the comments of `app/libs/chunking.ts`
2. Review the examples above showing what `getLastWords()` should return
3. See the complete solution in `app/libs/chunking.solution.ts`
4. Or ask your instructor for guidance!

**Common mistakes:**
- Forgetting to check if text is already short enough
- Not looping backwards (starting from the end)
- Forgetting to account for spaces between words (`+ 1`)
- Building the string in the wrong order

---

### The Type Definition

```typescript
export type Chunk = {
	id: string;
	content: string;
	metadata: {
		source: string;
		chunkIndex: number;
		totalChunks: number;
		startChar: number;
		endChar: number;
		[key: string]: string | number | boolean | string[];
	};
};
```

### Understanding the Implementation

The implementation in `app/libs/chunking.ts` follows these key steps:

**1. Split into sentences**

```typescript
const sentences = text.split(/[.!?]+/).filter((s) => s.trim().length > 0);
```

**2. Build chunks with overlap**

-   Accumulate sentences until chunk size is reached
-   When size limit hit, save current chunk
-   Start next chunk with overlap from previous chunk
-   Track metadata (indices, positions)

**3. Helper function `getLastWords()`**

-   Gets the last N characters worth of words
-   Used to create overlap between chunks
-   Ensures context preservation

**4. Update total chunks count**

-   After all chunks created, update each chunk's `totalChunks` metadata

## Experiment: Try Different Parameters

Now that you understand the implementation, experiment with different chunking parameters:

```typescript
// In a test file or Node REPL
import { chunkText } from './app/libs/chunking';

const text = 'Your long document here...';

// Try different chunk sizes
const smallChunks = chunkText(text, 200, 40, 'test');
const largeChunks = chunkText(text, 1000, 100, 'test');

console.log(`Small chunks: ${smallChunks.length}`);
console.log(`Large chunks: ${largeChunks.length}`);

// Try different overlap amounts
const noOverlap = chunkText(text, 500, 0, 'test');
const highOverlap = chunkText(text, 500, 150, 'test');
```

**Questions to explore:**

-   What chunk size works best for your content?
-   How much overlap do you need?
-   What happens with very short documents?
-   What happens with very long documents?
