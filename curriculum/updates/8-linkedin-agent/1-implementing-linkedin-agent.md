# LinkedIn Agent

Now that we have our fine-tuned model and understand how to use structured outputs, we'll create an agent that uses the fine-tuned model to respond in Brian's LinkedIn style.

## What You'll Build

An agent that:
- Uses the fine-tuned model from module 5
- Responds to questions about Brian's professional background
- Maintains the conversational style learned during fine-tuning

## Implementation

The agent implementation is in `app/libs/agents/linkedin.ts`.
