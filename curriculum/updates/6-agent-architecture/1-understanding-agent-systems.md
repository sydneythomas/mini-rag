# Understanding Agent Systems

You've built the foundation - now let's make your RAG system intelligent. Agents are specialized AI systems that handle different types of tasks. Think of them like departments in a company.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this module, you'll understand:
- What agents are and why we need them
- How to route requests to the right agent
- The agent architecture pattern
- How to build an agent selector

## The Problem: One Model Can't Do Everything Well

Imagine you have a chatbot that needs to:
- Answer questions about your LinkedIn content (needs your writing style)
- Answer questions about React documentation (needs up-to-date info)
- Handle casual conversation (needs general knowledge)

**One approach: Use one model for everything**
```typescript
// ❌ The naive approach
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  messages: [
    { role: 'system', content: 'Answer any question' },
    { role: 'user', content: userMessage }
  ]
});
```

**Problems:**
- Can't fine-tune for specific tasks
- No specialized knowledge retrieval
- Same prompt for all scenarios
- Expensive (always uses big model)

---

## The Solution: Agent Architecture

Instead, use specialized agents:

```
User Question
    ↓
┌─────────────┐
│   Selector  │ ← Analyzes question and conversation
│   Agent     │   Decides which agent to use
└─────────────┘
    ↓
    ├→ LinkedIn Agent (fine-tuned model)
    ├→ RAG Agent (retrieval + GPT-4o)
    └→ ... more agents
    ↓
Specialized Response
```

**Benefits:**
- Right tool for the job
- Better quality answers
- More cost effective
- Easy to add new capabilities

---

## Real-World Analogy

Think of a hospital:

**Bad approach: One doctor**
- One generalist doctor sees every patient
- Slower, less specialized care
- Can't be expert in everything

**Good approach: Specialists**
- Triage nurse routes patients
- Cardiologist handles heart issues
- Orthopedist handles broken bones
- Each is an expert in their domain

Your AI system works the same way!

## Understanding the Components

### 1. Agent Types (`app/agents/types.ts`)

```typescript
export type AgentType = 'linkedin' | 'rag';

export interface AgentRequest {
  type: AgentType;           // Which agent is handling this
  query: string;             // Refined/summarized query
  originalQuery: string;     // What user actually said
  messages: Message[];       // Full conversation history
}

export type AgentResponse = StreamTextResult; // Streamed response
```

**Key insight: The AgentRequest interface**

This is your contract. Every agent receives the same structure but handles it differently:
- `type`: So the agent knows what it's supposed to do
- `query`: Refined query (selector removed fluff)
- `originalQuery`: Maintains user's exact words
- `messages`: For context-aware responses

### 2. Agent Config (`app/agents/config.ts`)

```typescript
export const agentConfigs: Record<AgentType, AgentConfig> = {
  linkedin: {
    name: 'LinkedIn Agent',
    description: 'For questions about LinkedIn, professional networking...'
  },
  rag: {
    name: 'RAG Agent',
    description: 'For questions about documentation, technical content...'
  }
};
```

**Why separate config?**
- Single source of truth
- Selector uses descriptions to route
- Easy to add new agents (just add to config)
- Documentation stays in sync with code

### 3. Agent Registry (`app/agents/registry.ts`)

```typescript
type AgentExecutor = (request: AgentRequest) => Promise<AgentResponse>;

export const agentRegistry: Record<AgentType, AgentExecutor> = {
  linkedin: linkedInAgent,
  rag: ragAgent,
};
```

**The Registry Pattern**

This is a common software pattern:
1. Map string keys to functions
2. Type-safe lookup
3. Runtime routing
4. Easy to extend

Think of it like a phone directory - given an agent name, quickly find the function to call.

---

## The Agent Selector: The Brain

Located at: `app/api/select-agent/route.ts`

This is the "triage nurse" of your system.

### What It Does

**Input:** Conversation history (last 5 messages)

**Process:**
1. Analyzes the conversation context
2. Determines user intent
3. Refines the query (removes conversational fluff)
4. Chooses the best agent

**Output:** `{ agent: 'rag', query: 'How do I use React hooks?' }`

### Why Last 5 Messages?

```typescript
const recentMessages = messages.slice(-5);
```

**Reasoning:**
- Maintains conversation context
- Understands follow-up questions
- Not too much context (cost + latency)
- Captures recent intent shift

Example:
```
User: "Tell me about yourself"
Bot: "I'm a RAG assistant..."
User: "What about hooks?" ← Without context, unclear!
```

With context, selector knows "hooks" refers to React (from earlier messages).

### The Selector Prompt

```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are an agent router.
Based on the conversation history, determine which agent should handle
the request and create a focused query.

Available agents:
- "linkedin": For professional networking questions
- "rag": For technical documentation questions

Respond with: { "agent": "rag", "query": "clear focused query" }`;
```

**Why this works:**
- Clear instructions
- Explicit agent descriptions
- Structured output (JSON)
- Query refinement built-in

---

## Query Refinement: Why It Matters

**User says:** "yo can you tell me like what's the deal with that state management thing you mentioned earlier?"

**Selector refines to:** "What is React state management?"

**Benefits:**
- Better embedding matching (if using RAG)
- Clearer intent for the agent
- Removes noise ("yo", "like", "you mentioned")
- More precise retrieval

---

## The Chat Route: Tying It Together

Located at: `app/api/chat/route.ts`

This route receives:
```typescript
{
  messages: [...conversation],
  agent: 'rag',
  query: 'refined query'
}
```

Then:
1. Gets the agent executor from registry
2. Builds the AgentRequest
3. Executes the agent
4. Returns the stream

**Beautiful simplicity:** The route doesn't care HOW agents work, just that they follow the contract. Each agent is a black box that takes a request and returns a stream.

---

## Why This Architecture?

### Separation of Concerns

```
┌─────────────────┐
│ Select Agent    │ ← Routing logic
├─────────────────┤
│ Execute Agent   │ ← Execution logic
├─────────────────┤
│ LinkedIn Agent  │ ← Domain logic (professional)
├─────────────────┤
│ RAG Agent       │ ← Domain logic (documentation)
└─────────────────┘
```

Each layer has ONE job. Easy to:
- Test individually
- Modify without breaking others
- Add new agents
- Debug issues

### Type Safety

```typescript
// TypeScript prevents:
getAgent('invalid-agent') // ❌ Type error!
getAgent('rag')           // ✅ Works!

// And ensures:
every agent returns AgentResponse
every agent receives AgentRequest
```

### Extensibility

Want to add a "coding" agent? Four simple steps:

1. Add to types: `'linkedin' | 'rag' | 'coding'`
2. Add to config (name + description)
3. Add to registry (map to function)
4. Implement the agent function

Done! The selector automatically knows about it because it reads from the config.

---

## Common Patterns & Best Practices

### 1. Always Include Both Queries

Agents should receive BOTH the original and refined queries:
- **Original**: Captures user's tone/style/exact words
- **Refined**: Captures the core intent
- **Together**: Gives complete context

### 2. Error Handling

**Fail fast:** If configuration is missing (like API keys), throw errors immediately during initialization, not later when handling requests.

### 3. Streaming Responses

All agents return streams, not complete responses:
- Better UX (user sees response immediately)
- Lower perceived latency
- Can cancel long responses
- Industry standard for chat apps

## What's Next?

Now you understand the architecture. Time to implement the agents themselves!

**Coming up:**
- Building the LinkedIn agent with a fine-tuned model
- Building the RAG agent with retrieval
- Connecting everything to the UI
