Learning to deploy a web app with a custom domain that looks good on mobile is an important milestone.\n\nConsider this:\n\n- Instead of trying to build 100 small projects that look like everyone else's, build 1 or 2 complex projects and deploy them.\n- Consider integrating an LLM. Perhaps leverage RAG.\n- Try and get a user or 3.\n- Buy a domain.\n- Set up analytics to track who's on there and for how long.\n\nYou will walk away with a small business or a cool story that's light years beyond a glorified TODO app."}]}

There I was, confronted with my own limitations.\n\nI could barely keep up with the tasks I was assigned and relied on lots of pairing sessions to get my work done.\n\nI made a resolution to suck less.\n\n- I asked the smarty-pants devs what books they suggested I read\n- I audited my Javascript knowledge and wrote out what I knew I had to learn\n- I enrolled in a course to learn DSA and comp sci fundamentals\n\nI never became the 2nd worst developer at this company, but I grew my technical skills, confidence and threshold for failure.\n\nSo if you're discovering just how little you know... good.

Single responsibility isn't just for classes.\n4. Is this code necessary? The best code is often no code at all.\n\nMore code === more bugs.\nMore code === more maintenance.\nMore code === more code.\n\nThe barrier to entry for launching an app is now non-existent.

During the interview though, he didn't come off as such.\n\nHis answers were short and to the point. He cut me off a few times. When I asked about a project he had worked on, he gave a basic overview of a trivial feature and didn't offer much detail. He used internal names for the app which didn't make sense to me.\n\nAfter the interview, I brought some of these issues to his attention.\n\nWe dug into his former role and the work he did. It was interesting. He had worked on challenging technical problems across the stack.\n\nSo why in the hell wasn't he mentioning this in the interview?\n\nHe was genuinely surprised with my perception and feedback. 100 interviews deep and here he was getting this hot-take for the first time.\n\nCompanies will rarely give feedback to candidates.
