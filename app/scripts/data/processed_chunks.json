Using Truth TablesA truth table is usually used in Boolean Algebra to express the mathematical outcome produced from a combination of values. We can apply this same logic to creating tests by writing a set of conditions and the expected outcome. This not only makes our code easier to reason about, it also makes more concise tests that can be easily modified to add different conditions to test when our function or component inevitably changes.",

    "content": "Is mapStateToProps causing needless re-renders. Pictured: simple redux flow between connected components 😫If you are a React developer working on a less than trivial project, you are likely using Redux for state management. In a crude nutshell, your connected components are all listening for any updates to the store, the global state of the app, and your mapStateToProps function takes some slice of this state and returns it as props to your connected component.",

When code reviews are good they can be used to build community, trust and teach. At worst, they become punitive, nerve-wracking and destructive. Lemme give you a little story. I was well into my career as a developer and working at a new company. I was reviewing some code for an epic which I wasn’t too familiar with, written by a developer who was more senior than me.",

In more complex applications eventually managing local state and sharing data across components may get unwieldy. In order to centralize your state logic you can leverage a library like Redux.",

The Compound Components pattern is a design pattern in which components are used together so they can share state, allowing them to communicate with each other but are loosely coupled.

I think this can prevent swiss-army knife components where you need a component to render differently depending on the context while still enforcing some standards and structure. The shopping cart is a component that lends itself to this pattern well or some other structured UI like an article where you will likely have some common elements that you want to compose in 1 of n ways. Hope that sheds some light on my thought process.",

If you’ve been through the job hunt as a developer, you probably have at least one horrific interview experience.

Nothing major, just 15 - 30 minutes a night before I went to sleep. Read lots of books on coding (and a lot of awful mystery novels).",

Well, simply put, a framework developer is a person who depends on the abstraction of their programming language via a framework (or library in the case of ReactJS) to develop applications. The problem with being a framework (or library) developer is that when your framework goes out of favor, so do you. Without a grasp of the fundamentals upon which it was built, you’re now tied to the abstraction.",
