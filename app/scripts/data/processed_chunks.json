A Redux action will trigger a reducer to update an object, but importantly, it will not mutate the object but instead return a new object with the updated values.",

Instead of getting caught up in the dogma of functional approaches, use common sense techniques like function composition, immutability and function purity to write the kind of code that will make your application easier to read, test and less buggy.",

Giving short and informative status updates either in a DM to your manager or to a relevant channel brings your work out of the shadows.

The price tag was trivial compared to what the average programs costs nowadays — $2000 for 12 weeks — but to me, at that time, this was a sum of money that I figured I might not soon see again. I needed to make this work. In the months leading up to my program, I furiously studied, spending my weekends and free time building awful looking sites after learning HTML and CSS then learning enough Jquery and Javascript to be dangerous.",

Weekends were the worst. I needed something to fill in the time I spent at bars or milling around the city in a drunken stupor. Movies take up large chunks of time. So I rented and went out to every movie that looked watchable. It’s still one of my favorite sober habits.",

I didn’t exactly know why I was running but I kept at it. I liked the feeling at the end of a run and letting my mind wander during it.",

Hot take: Don’t. Within reason. There’s no point in chasing money if you don’t take time to enjoy it. Personally, the biggest change in my life is that I don’t constantly HAVE to think about money. I buy groceries, pay bills and save without too much worry.",

    "content": "What They Really Mean When They Say “Just Use AI”When people first started talking about AI in tech, the promise felt exciting: we have a new tool to push the boundaries of what’s possible. But what it’s turned into is something very different. Today, when someone tells you to “just use AI,” what they really mean is:Do it faster. Not better. Not smarter. Not safer. Just faster. And if the quality is worse. Who cares.",

But the uncomfortable truth is that nobody really cares. Companies don’t care about quality if they can shave a few hours off a sprint.",
